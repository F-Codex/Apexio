## 💻 Installation Guide

Ensure you have **PHP 8.2+**, **Composer**, and **Node.js** installed before starting.

### 1. Initial Setup
Run the following commands in your terminal (Command Prompt / Bash):
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/noireveil/Apexio.git
cd Apexio

# Install Backend & Frontend dependencies
composer install
npm install

# Duplicate environment configuration
cp .env.example .env

# Generate Application Key
php artisan key:generate
```

### 2. Database Configuration
Open the `.env` file and adjust the database configuration (`DB_DATABASE=apexio`). Then follow the steps for your operating system:

#### A. Windows Users (Laragon/XAMPP)
1. Ensure Laragon/XAMPP is running (Start All).
2. Open HeidiSQL (Laragon) or phpMyAdmin.
3. Create a new database named: `apexio`.
4. Ensure the `.env` file matches your credentials (Laragon default is usually user: `root`, password: empty).

#### B. Linux Users (Terminal)
1. Ensure the database service is running: `sudo systemctl start mariadb` (or `mysql`).
2. Login to MySQL and create the database:
```bash
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE apexio;"
```
3. Adjust the database username and password in the `.env` file if you use custom credentials.

### 3. Migration & Storage
Once the database is ready, run the following commands in the project terminal to create tables and seed initial data:
```bash
# Create tables and seed initial data (Seeder)
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

# Create a shortcut so profile photos are publicly accessible (MANDATORY)
php artisan storage:link
```

### 4. Running the Application (IMPORTANT)
This application requires two terminal processes running simultaneously for the Backend functions and Frontend styling to work.

**Terminal 1 (Run Laravel Server):**
```bash
php artisan serve
```

**Terminal 2 (Run Asset Compilation / Vite):**
```bash
npm run dev
```

Access the application via browser at: **http://localhost:8000**
